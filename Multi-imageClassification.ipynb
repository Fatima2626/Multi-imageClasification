    "We balanced the distribution of images across classes by augmenting the dataset, ensuring each category has sufficient data for training. Using OpenCV, we implemented image augmentation techniques like rotation and flipping to create diverse variations of images, addressing class imbalances effectively. Additionally, we applied common image preprocessing techniques such as normalization, histogram equalization, and denoising to enhance image quality before feature extraction. These strategies collectively improved the dataset's quality and balance, making it suitable for computer vision tasks like classification or object detection."
